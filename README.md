Legend in Battles

Introduction

"Legend in Battles" is a simple text-based Python game where two legendary characters battle it out in a series of rounds to determine the ultimate winner. This project showcases the use of Python to create a fun and engaging game with basic functionality.

How to Play
Players enter the names and character types (Human, Elf, Wizard, or Orc) for two legendary characters.

The game randomly generates health and strength statistics for each character.

The characters face off in a series of three rounds, rolling dice to determine their success in each round.

The player with the higher dice roll wins the round and earns a point.

After three rounds, the game declares the overall winner based on the number of rounds won.

The game can be customized by entering different character names and types.

Features
Character creation: Players can name their legendary characters and choose their character types.

Randomized stats: The game generates random health and strength statistics for each character, adding an element of unpredictability.

Dice rolling: Characters engage in battles by rolling dice to determine the outcome of each round.

Winner declaration: The game calculates the overall winner based on the number of rounds won by each character.

Technologies Used
Python: The game is built entirely in Python, showcasing the use of Python's built-in randomization, input/output, and basic logic.

Time and OS modules: The time module is used to introduce delays between rounds, and the os module is used to clear the console screen for a better user experience.

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python installed.

Run the game by executing the legend_in_battles.py script.
